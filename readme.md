# Permanent Residency checker

### I wrote a simple promt based page in JS for my WebDev class, helping people to navigate the maze of german bureaucracy and check if they are eligable for permanent residency.

### Practiced:
*Collect user input via prompt*  
*Set criteria with && and ||*  
*Sort users into relevant groups*   
*Display messages based on result with if/else*  
*delay JS after pageload*
